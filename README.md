# PSContactCardSearch

This package contains a component to search contacts within a community page and return contacts in a card/grid layout.

Note: Currently this component has no configuration parameters as was developed for specific demo. Reach out to me if there is customization required.

<b>Dependency:</b> Install the [PSCommon](https://github.com/thedges/PSCommon) package first
